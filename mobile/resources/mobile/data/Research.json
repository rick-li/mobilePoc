This should not come as a huge surprise as the Annual Address normally has a broad perspective with focus on structural issues. The major were: 1) the latest economic crisis and new regulatory measures to promote financial stability, 2) the Government Pension Fund - Global (GPFG) and, 3) the fiscal policy rule. Generally, the tone of speech was balanced with Mr Olsen on the one hand pointing to the negative effects from abroad, high credit spreads and a strong NOK, and on the other hand rising house price growth and household debt, emphasizing that the \"Norges Bank still has \"room for manoeuvre in interest rate setting - in both directions\". We note that the Governor (surprisingly) refrained from commenting on the latest NOK strength. This should probably be seen in light of recent positive data releases abroad."

          "synopsis": "Focus on Dominican Republic  Political risk is overrated. We travelled to Santo Domingo and argue that sound economic policies will likely remain on track regardless of who wins the presidential election. In our view, political risk has been overrated in the country and therefore we are feeling even more comfortable with the credit. What We Think: Mexico - Market share of exports to the US consolidates. In December 2011 the share of Mexico in total US manufacturing imports stood at 11.7% up from 11.4% a year earlier. Mexico\u0027s market share of the key US import market appears to be consolidating at higher levels than the previous peak of 2001. A cheaper real exchange rate in multilateral terms is probably one factor at play. News in Brief. Moody\u0027s downgrades Belize\u0027s bond rating to Caa1 from B3. In Brazil, monthly economic activity increased 0.6% MoM in December. Chile\u0027s fuel prices posted weekly changes ranging from -1.3% (Kerosene) to 0.7% (Gasolina 97). The Colombian Constitutional Court declared that the \"mini\" tax reform of 2010 was constitutional. Peru\u0027s GDP grew 6% y/y in December 2011 and 6.9% for the year as a whole. In Venezuela, 4Q11 GDP growth came in at 4.9% y/y and for the whole of 2011 it stood at 4.2%."

          "synopsis": "We expect the customs clearance trade balance to show a deficit of JPY1.2480trn before seasonal adjustment (-JPY479.4bn in Jan. 2011) and a deficit of JPY670.3bn (-JPY567.6bn) after adjustment in January. The latter would be the tenth consecutive monthly deficit. We note that January data tend to be volatile because of a changing timing of Chinese New Year. This year, it started on January 23 (February 3 last year) and probably depressed both exports and imports in the month."

          "synopsis": "Yesterday\u0027s Annual Address by Norges Bank Governor Olsen did not give any new signals on monetary policy. This should not come as a huge surprise as the Annual Address normally has a broad perspective with focus on structural issues. Occasionally, though, it has given new market signals. The major themes in yesterday\u0027s Address were: 1) the latest economic crisis and new regulatory measures to promote financial stability, 2) the oil fund and, 3) the fiscal policy rule. Generally, the tone of speech was balanced with Mr Olsen on the one hand pointing to the negative effects from abroad, high credit spreads and a strong NOK, and on the other hand rising house price growth and household debt, emphasizing that the \"Norges Bank still has \"room for manoeuvre in interest rate setting - in both directions\". We note that the Governor (surprisingly) refrained from commenting on the latest NOK strength. This should probably be seen in light of recent positive data releases abroad."
