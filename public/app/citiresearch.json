The November outturn brings the 12-month rolling deficit to US$77.8 bn, with the gap on track to exceed 10% of GDP in 2011. In parallel, the non-energy current account deficit of about US$27.2 bn in the first eleven months of 2011 doesn\u0027t compare favorably with a deficit of US$9.0 bn in the same period of 2010, highlighting the degree of deterioration in Turkey\u0027s underlying external performance. Nonetheless, a quick glance at the seasonally adjusted data suggests that an external adjustment is underway, though its pace remains slower-than-desired in terms of bringing the deficit closer to its norm."

The latest figure is the highest aggregate pension deficit since data began in 2003. There have been small changes in the calculation over that period, but these are unlikely to alter that stark record. The PPF report that 84% of pension schemes are in deficit, up from 60% a year earlier. Over the last six months, the value of pension fund liabilities rose by 26%, while the pension fund assets rose by just 1%. Pension fund liabilities are discounted using gilt yields, and hence have been lifted by lower gilt yields (exacerbated by QE). The PPF methodology implies that a 0.3% drop in gilt yields lifts pension fund assets by about 1% but lifts liabilities by about 5%, hence worsening the net funding position markedly."

This followed two months of double digit declines. We suspect some of the gain may be a statistical bounce, but the delivery of a cut in official interest rates and expectations of further easings could have injected some renewed confidence into potential owner-occupiers and investors in the month. The RBA will likely want more recent evidence of conditions in the housing market for consideration at the February 7 Board meeting. The RBA had noted in the Minutes of the December Board meeting the decline in residential approvals in previous months. We do not believe that the increase in November headline approval numbers will do much to change the Bank\u0027s view of subdued conditions in the new housing market. This is because of the further reduction in the value of approvals. On balance, we believe that the RBA will place this data release on the shelf, to be considered against more recent liaison evidence of conditions in the property market before the Board next meets."

The information was unsurprising given the enormity of downside risks and uncertainties weighing on the economy. On balance, the data are consistent with both our and the bank\u0027s expectations of slower Canadian growth, a less robust capex revival and softer inflation in 2012. We anticipate no change in the monetary policy stance next week."

          "synopsis": "The headline inflation rate was again surprising. The monthly CPI rate in December was well above what we and the Banamex Survey consensus anticipated. A greater-than-expected rise in farm prices explains more than half of our own forecasting error. Its monthly rate (4.29% versus our forecast of 3.26%) reflected the impact of recent droughts in the north of Mexico and flooding in the south. These effects drove up poultry and red meat prices, also increasing the volatility characteristic of these items. These effects are almost entirely transitory, in our view, and we do not therefore consider that they will affect the inflation dynamic for the next few months."

          "synopsis": "Broad money growth rebounded on seasonal fiscal spending spree - M2 grew by 13.6% YoY in December, above our and market expectation. M1 grew by 7.9% YoY, consistent with our estimate. The main impetus for M2 growth came from the fiscal policy. During the month, fiscal deposits in the banking system declined by Rmb1.3tn (roughly 2.8% of GDP), indicating a monthly fiscal deficit of a similar magnitude. For the year as a whole, we estimate that the fiscal deficit reached about 1% of GDP, half of the budgeted level. As a result, non-fiscal RMB deposits increased by Rmb2.7tn during the month."
